UI : Lightning

Setup Case to Case lookup. 

Setup a custom object named “Cool_Info__c” which will have a lookup relationship to Contact.

On Contact Object a User_Id__c field should be created which is an external id field.  
Setup a custom object named “Address__c” which will have a lookup relationship to Contact. 
Address__c fields :
    • All address fields from contact object
    • Lookup to contact 
    • Occured_On__c date time

A platform event should be created which has information about the Contact External Id and the address fields, on its consumption it should create an Address__c record, fill in all fields and set the latest Address (can be checked by Occured_On__c on the related Address records of the contact and those that are coming in from the platform event). 

When Contact Address has been updated it should automatically request the “Geocoding Data” from the google api via rest. 

User wants a button on Contact Object which will allow him to receive Geocoding Data of the user address and save it on the record.

When Geocoding Data has been retrieved a case should be created with Subject “Check Geocoding Data” 

On Case creation a random guid should be generated and set on the External_Id__c field on the case.

When case has been closed a platform event should be published which contains the external id of the case, and on the trigger of the event it should create  a new case with subject “I am done” linked to the Case which was closed.
